Dynamic DNS
===========

It is really useful,
if the home server is available from everywhere.
My router is responsible for updating DNS entries.

Selfhost.de
-----------

Provides dynamic DNS for free.

One problem:
No Lets Encrypt certificates,
because "Too many certificates already issued for: selfhost.eu".
