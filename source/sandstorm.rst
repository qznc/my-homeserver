Sandstorm
=========

`Sandstorm <https://sandstorm.io/>`_
is a self-hosted web productivity suite,
as they describe it themselves.
It allows to install stuff on your server from an app store,
like you install apps on your smartphone.
The app store could use more options,
but it is preferable to installing stuff yourself.
