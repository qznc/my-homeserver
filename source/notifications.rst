Notifications
=============

Sometimes things go wrong.
Hardware fail.
Updates fail.
Space runs out.

In such cases,
the server must be able to contact you, the admin.

E-Mail
------

The usual way is to send emails.

Instant Message
---------------

A more modern way is use some instant messenger.

Usually, I recommend `Signal <https://whispersystems.org/>`_,
but they do not like bots.
Likewise, WhatsApp, which is really popular.

Threema? Wire? Matrix? Jabber?

Supervising
-----------

Nagios and Munin?
