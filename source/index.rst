My Home Server v0.1
===================

I plan to build and maintain a cheap home server.
Here I document my design choices,
configuration, and maybe even teach a few Linux things.

For version 0.x,
I will only use a VM.
When I actually buy hardware and use it,
that will be version 1.0.
If I buy new hardware,
it will be version 2.0.
And so forth.
