My Home Server v0.1
===================

I plan to build and maintain a cheap home server.
Here I document my design choices,
configuration, and maybe even teach a few Linux things.

For version 0.1,
I only used a VM.
Then I switched to an old laptop.
It is a weak dual core Intel Atom N570 with 1GB RAM and 300GB disk.
