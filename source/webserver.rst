Web Server
==========

Having a web server,
which serves as a reverse proxy to your other stuff
is one of the basics.

Since performance or scalability is not really goal here,
we use Apache instead of Nginx.
Apache is a little bit more flexible,
maybe we will need that.

.. code::

   apt install apache2
